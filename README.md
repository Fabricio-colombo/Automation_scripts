# Automation Project with PyAutoGUI: Automated Filling of Digital Tables

The "automation_scripts" project aims to automate actions on the desktop using the PyAutoGUI library, focusing on filling in information in a digital table. The script starts by opening the Chrome browser through the system's search bar. After accessing a specific link, it automatically logs in, providing the predefined email and password. It then uses data from a "products.csv" file to fill out an online form, where each line in the file corresponds to a product. The filling includes fields such as code, brand, type, category, unit price, cost, and notes. The script finishes by submitting the information and scrolling the page upward. This project is useful for automating repetitive tasks, saving time, and minimizing human errors.
